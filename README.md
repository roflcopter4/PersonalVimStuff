# PersonalVimStuff
Is my personal vim stuff.

Includes:

  *  Modified molokai color scheme
  *  Slightly modified nova color sheme
  *  Slightly modified version of numbers.vim
  *  Additions to syntax highlighing of shell scripts.

In all, not much. The molokai scheme is really the only thing worth the bother.
